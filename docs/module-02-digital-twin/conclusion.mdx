## 14.6 Final Thoughts

**Digital twins are not perfect replicas**—they are **tools for risk reduction** and **accelerators for development**. The goal is not 100% simulation accuracy, but **sufficient fidelity** to validate algorithms before hardware deployment.

**Key principles to remember**:

1. **Start simple**: Perfect model in simple environment → realistic model → complex environment
2. **Iterate quickly**: Fast sim (RTF = 5-10×) beats slow, perfect sim
3. **Embrace randomization**: Robust policies outperform overfitted ones
4. **Validate continuously**: Monitor real-world performance, update sim accordingly
5. **Sim2real is a loop**: Deploy → collect data → refine → re-train

**You now have the skills to**:
- Build digital twins for any robotic system
- Train AI agents 10× faster than pure hardware testing
- Bridge the sim2real gap with domain randomization and system ID
- Debug complex simulation issues independently
- Deploy simulation-trained policies to real robots
